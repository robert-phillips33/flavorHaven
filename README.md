Falvor Haven has the option to save the racipes the user likes for later use. The website offers detailed step by step instructions to create one of the recipies. It also offers the total price of the recipe based on the amount of ingrediets needed to make it. Flavor Haven aims to make meal planning and cooking enjoyable and accessible for everyone.

## Context:

- At Turing, in the first week of Mod 2, we were assigned to create a recipe website. Our responsibilities included developing the website's functionality by writing tests based on user, recipe, and ingredient criteria. During the testing phase, we created functions to filter recipes by name, tag, and ingredient, as well as to calculate the total cost of ingredients and return instructions for a given recipe.

- In the user phase of the assignment, we implemented features that allowed users to filter recipes by tag, name, and ingredient. Users could also add or remove recipes from their saved recipes section and search for saved recipes by name or tag.

- In the final phase of the project, we transitioned from using a hardcoded data file to using a fetch call to receive data. After researching Promise.all(), we successfully gathered data by fetching it with this static method.

## Learning Goals:
- Utilize `object` and `array` prototype methods for effective data manipulation.

- Create a user friendly interface that clearly presents information.

- Develop a comprehensive testing suite using `Test-Driven Development` (TDD)

- Perform network requests to fetch data. 


### Wins + Challenges üèÜ:
- Wins
  - We communicated effectively early on to set a side a schedule to work on this project.
  - We discussed ideas and other perspectives before moving on to the next task.
  - We learned how to create a table in our HTML file as a team.

- Challenges
  - We had a problem importing images early on the project. We thought it would be adding the image in a file and writing the path in the source in the HTML file. But we learned we had to import it in the script JS file to display the image on the page. 

### Part 2 Specific
- In the second part of the project, we fetched our API data from a local server. We cloned the local server and ran it in a separate terminal tab while running our recipe page. We used a POST request to save users favorite recipes to the local API. This ensured the users favorite recipes are visible even after refreshing the page. 

- To address accessibility, we used tools like `Lighthouse` and `WAVE` to test and improve accessibility. The tools gave us feedbacks on what needs to be fixed based on a missing `label` or having improper color scheme.
